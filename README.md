## My Learning Journey

Learning Python has been an exhilarating experience. Starting from scratch, I faced challenges understanding the basics, but through persistence and a passion for coding, I overcame obstacles. This inventory system is not just a project; it's a testament to the progress I've made in a short time.

## About the Project

This Computer Inventory System was my first semester project, and it reflects the newfound familiarity I've developed with the fundamentals of Python. While I encountered difficulties along the way, each obstacle served as a learning opportunity. I'm excited to continue refining this project and exploring more in the vast world of programming, InshaAllah.
